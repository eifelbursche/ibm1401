# Ibm1401
Some programs and documentation about the IBM1401 and the "the virtual data center a fully working walkable 1401 3D simulation - for free"
<br>
<br>
The idea is to provide a single source of information and tapes/card desks for use with the VCD and/or SIMH or any other simulator.
<br>

Comprehesive information about the IBM 1401 can be found at https://ibm-1401.info/<br>
